    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will learn commands to allow you to create repositories for projects, capstone and other collaborative efforts. These will allow you to share your work with the instructional team for help and support throughout class, keep versioning (locally and backed up online) and build skills necessary to interact with team\n",

    "In git there are several basic operations:\n",
    "- **Init** - This initializes or create a new repository (turn on the ability for file tracking)\n",
    "- **Add** -  Adds a change in the working directory to the staging area\n",
    "- **Commit** - Captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to. \n",
    "- **Push** - used to upload local repository content to a remote repository\n",
    "- **Pull** - Fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.\n",
    "    -**Note** Technically it's a combination of a fetch and a merge command\n",
    "- **Clone** - Clones a repository into a newly created directory\n",
    "- **Status** - Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some advanced operations:\n",
    "- **Branching**\n",
    "- **Merging**\n",

    "SSH, or Secure SHell, is a common means of adding an additional layer of security.  Simply put, SSH is used to establish authenticity between a client and a server so that a secure connection can be formed.  This can be useful for secure file sharing or remote application access.  \n",

    "\n",

    "3. Client provides authentication.\n",
