## Learning Objectives

The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the basic toolset used for the Data Science Fundamentals class. These include *Command Line*, *Git* & *Git Hub Enterprise*, *Jupyter Notebooks* and *Spyder* an interactive development environment (IDE).

Understanding these tools allows students to:
1. Access a local copy of class resources
2. Interact with the resources on their computer
3. Save in class or project progress on their own online repository
4. Collaborate with the Instructional team or their classmates on projects, capstones, labs or challenges

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

### Part 1 : Using the Command Line

- Create folders and files using the command line (`mkdir`, `touch`).
- Change directories and list directory content (`cd`, `ls`).
- Check the current working directory (`pwd`).

### Part 2 : Introduction to Git

- Use and explain common Git commands, including `init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, and `clone`.
- Distinguish between local and remote repositories.
- Create, copy, and delete repositories locally or on GitHub.
- Clone remote repositories.
- Establish Secure Shell connections to remote repositories.

## Lesson Outline

> Instructor Note: The Jupyter Notebook Practice can be used as a take-home practice assignment. Students often do not understand Git right away, so the majority of this lesson will be understanding and practicing Git.
