## Materials
<!--- This section is a table of contents for the lesson. The table structure breaks down repo resources into types, distinguishing between lesson notebooks and other supporting materials. Note that the table below demonstrates the total possible range of materials. Most lessons won't require all of these categories. Also note that every item in the repo should get its own line and link. --->

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Presentation | Introduction to the classroom, Data Science & the DS Workflow | [here](./WelcomeToDataScience.pdf)
| Part 1. Data Science Definitions | Jupyter notebook reviewing common terms, topics, & course info | [here](./course_info_definitions.ipynb) |
| Part 2. Development Environment | A quick check to ensure that git and Anaconda are working | [here](./install_check.md) |
| Python Practice | Jupyter notebook review of Python programming fundamentals | [here](./practice/intro_to_python_fundamentals.ipynb) |
