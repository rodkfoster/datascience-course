    "X's are independent of each other (little to no multicollinearity)\n",
    "Resulting values pass a linear assumption \n",
    "\n",
    "The regression has six key assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear relationship between target and features\n",
    "2. Data is normally distributed or contains Multivariate normality (but doesn't have to be)\n",
    "3. No or little multicollinearity\n",
    "4. No auto-correlation\n",
    "5. Homoscedasticity\n",
    "6. Independent features\n",

    "Note: If data is not normally distributed, we could be introducing bias\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Linear Relationship** \n",
    "\n",
    "First, linear regression needs the relationship between the independent and dependent variables to be linear.  It is also important to check for outliers since linear regression is sensitive to outlier effects.  The linearity assumption can best be tested with scatter plots\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Normal Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the linear regression analysis requires all variables to be multivariate normal it can be checked with a histogram or Q-Q plot. Normality can also be checked with a goodness of fit test like the [Kolmogorov-Smirnov] test(https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.kstest.html) . When the data is not normally distributed it's possible a non-linear transformation (e.g., log-transformation) might fix this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Low to No Multicollinearity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity occurs when the independent variables are too highly correlated with each other. A quick way to test this is our tried and true correlation matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "If multicollinearity is found in the data centering the data, that is deducting the mean score might help to solve the problem.  Other alternatives to tackle the problems is conducting a factor analysis and rotating the factors to insure independence of the factors in the linear regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Low to No Auto-correlation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression analysis requires that there is little or no autocorrelation in the data.  Autocorrelation occurs when the residuals are not independent from each other.  In other words when the value of y(x+1) is not independent from the value of y(x). Examples are signal processing or time series data\n",
    "\n",
    "While a scatterplot allows you to check for autocorrelations, you can test the linear regression model for autocorrelation with the [Durbin-Watson test](http://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.stats.stattools.durbin_watson.html).  Durbin-Watson’s d tests the null hypothesis that the residuals are not linearly auto-correlated.  While d can assume values between 0 and 4, values around 2 indicate no autocorrelation.  As a rule of thumb values of 1.5 < d < 2.5 show that there is no auto-correlation in the data. However, the Durbin-Watson test only analyses linear autocorrelation and only between direct neighbors, which are first order effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Homoscedasticity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedastic data means the residuals are equal across the regression line. We can test this with scatterplots or seaborn's lmplot()\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Independent features**\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent features are in no way derived from other features. Imagine a dataset composed of three features. The first two features are in no way related but the third feature is simply the sum of the first two. That means this ficitonal dataset has one linearly dependent feature. That’s a problem for linear regression since we expect to interpret our outputs as X increase in feature A drives an increase of Y units of the response variable. However, if features are correlated, you lose the ability to interpret the linear regression model because you violate a fundamental assumption."

The intercept is now the average of our outcome, and the magnitude of each coefficient in the model is a measure of how important it is in the model. We call this feature importance."
