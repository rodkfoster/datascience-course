    "> There are several _standard_ data types within Python (and typically any programming language, although it varies as to what is or isn't in a type for each). \n",
    "\n",
    "> A type tells the computer what can or can't be done with a given piece of information in Python (or whichever programming language you are using). For example, we can **add** and **subtract** numbers and we can **count** the number of letters in a word. Rather than try (and fail!) to add two words together or count the number of numbers in a number, types let the computer know efficiently what can and cannot be done in a given situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Different languages have different requirements for typing, known broadly as _static versus dynamic_ typing and _strong versus weak typing_:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Static typing**: When we create a variable, we tell the program what type it is, and it stays that way for the evaluation of the program.\n",
    "- **Dynamic typing**: When we create a variable, it can be of any type and can be changed if we redefine it in the program.\n",
    "- **Strong typing**: A variable's type determines what can and cannot be done with it (such as dividing a word).\n",
    "- **Weak typing**: You can try to do anything with that variable and, if it can be converted in the process to make that operation work, the language will do so.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Python is a _dynamic, strongly typed_ language — while we can redefine a variable's type as we work with it, Python won't change types on us unless we explicitly tell it to do so. This is a design choice of Python; different languages do things differently (if you pick up R, C++, or Java in the future, expect differences).\n",

    "**Collections**\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Lists:** An ordered sequence without a fixed number of elements, e.g., `x = [1, 2, 3]`. Note the square brackets. `x = [\"Lord\", \"of\", \"the\", \"Rings\"]` — this can be changed as you like.\n",
    "- **Dictionaries**: An unordered collection of key-value pairs, e.g., `x = {'Mark': 'Twain', 'Apples': 5}`. To retrieve each value (the part after each colon), use its key (the part before each colon). For example, `x['Apples']` retrieves the value `5`."

Dictionaries do not have an order (so `x[0]` will fail), but they use the name of the key to return that element.\n",
