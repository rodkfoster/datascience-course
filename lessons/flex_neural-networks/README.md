## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
- **Understand** various types of neural networks
- **Discuss** applications of neural networks
- **Apply** a neural network model for regression
- **Apply** a neural network model for classification
- **Understand** the concepts behind perceptrons and hidden layers
- **Understand** back propagation


## Installation Notes
To procede through the lesson, first install `Keras` as explained below. We tend to prefer Anaconda-based installations, since they tend to be tested with our other Anaconda packages. 

1. ` conda install -c conda-forge keras tensorflow`
