> This lesson purposefully uses a large number of datasets. This allows students to practice opening different types of data files. So, it would be useful to emphasize manually looking at the files to identify the separator and header. Having many datasets available allows us to explore a variety of themes throughout the lesson that might not be present in one dataset alone.

*Note: Datasets have 3 types. ".csv" files are separated by commas, ".tsv" by tabs, and ".tbl" by "|" character*
