    "## OPTIONAL: How Many Samples Are Needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "We often ask how large our data set should be to achieve a reasonable logistic regression result. Below, a few methods will be introduced for determining how accurate the resulting model will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule of Thumb\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick:** At least 100 samples total. At least 10 samples per feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula method:**\n",
    "1. Find the proportion $p$ of positive cases and negative cases. Take the smaller of the two. \n",
    "    - Ideally, you want 50/50 for a proportion of 0.5.\n",
    "    - Example: Suppose we are predicting \"male\" or \"female\". Our data is 80% male, 20% female. \n",
    "        - So, we choose the proportion $p = 0.2$ since it is smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Find the number of independent variables $k$.\n",
    "    - Example: We are predicting gender based on the last letter of the first name, giving us 26 indicator columns for features. So, $k = 26$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Let the minimum number of cases be $N = \\frac{10k}{p}$. The minimum should always be set to at least $100$.\n",
    "    - Example: Here, $N = 10*26 / 0.2 = 1300$. So, we would need 1300 names (supposing 80% are male).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods from: Long, J. S. (1997). *Regression Models for Categorical and Limited Dependent Variables*. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is one of the few machine learning models where we can obtain comprehensive statistics. By performing hypothesis testing, we can understand whether we have sufficient data to make strong conclusions about individual coefficients and the model as a whole. A very popular Python library which gives you these statistics with just a few lines of code is [statsmodels](http://www.statsmodels.org/dev/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Power Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may suspect, many factors affect how statistically significant the results of a logistic regression are. The art of estimating the sample size to detect an effect of a given size with a given degree of confidence is called power analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some factors that influence the accuracy of our resulting model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Desired statistical significance (p-value)\n",
    "+ Magnitude of the effect\n",
    "    - It is more difficult to distinguish a small effect from noise. So, more data would be required!\n",
    "+ Measurement precision\n",
    "+ Sampling error\n",
    "    - An effect is more difficult to detect in a smaller sample.\n",
    "+ Experimental design\n",
    "\n",
    "So, many factors, in addition to the number of samples, contribute to the resulting statistical power. Hence, it is difficult to give an absolute number without a more comprehensive analysis. This analysis is out of the scope of this lesson, but it is important to understand some of the factors that affect confidence."
