| --- | --- | --- |
| Lesson |  Part 1: Intro to clustering | [Here](./clustering.ipynb) |
| Lesson | Part 2: Overview of K-Means (*Optional*) | [Here](./intro-to-kmeans.ipynb) |
| Solution  | Part 2: Solution code for questions and exercises | [Here](./solution-code/02_clustering_adv-solution.ipynb) |

> This lesson uses a small beer dataset describing beer name, calories, sodium content, alcohol percentage, and cost. This data set is ideal because it is easy to read it all and clusters into identifiable categories.

## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, students will be able to:

### Part One: KMeans
- Determine the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Demonstrate how to apply k-means clustering.

### Part Two: DBScan
- Demonstrate how to apply density-based clustering (DBSCAN).
- Define the Silhouette Coefficient and explain how it relates to clustering.

---

## Student Requirements

Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to:
- Define basic principles of supervised learning.
- Intuit relevant information from k-NN and Voronoi diagrams.
- Prepare features and create models using scikit-learn.
- Graph data using Matplotlib.
