## Project Objective(s)

#### Description
Our final project asks you to apply your skills to a business problem of your choice. The capstone is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your new skills and tackle a pressing issue relevant to your team, division, or organization. Youâ€™ll generate a hypothesis, analyze internal data, and generate a working model, prototype, solution, or recommendation.

#### Deliverables
You will get structured guidance and designated time to work throughout the course. Final project deliverables include:

- **Project Proposal**: Describe your chosen problem and whether you have access to relevant data.
- **Project Brief**: Share a brief summary of your initial analysis and next steps in order to get assistance from your instructional team.
- **Technical Notebook**: Submit a cleanly formatted Jupyter notebook (or other files) documenting your code and process for technical/peer stakeholders.
- **Presentation**: Present a summary of your business problem, approach, and recommendation to an audience of non-technical executive stakeholders.

## Rubric

For all deliverables, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, instructors will provide you with feedback on required portions of your project.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Surpasses our wildest expectations!_

> Note: Scores of `2` mean that a requirement has been completely fulfilled, while `3` is typically reserved for bonus objectives.

## Project Submission

Instructors will explain how to submit project deliverables. Depending on the deliverable, this may be done by:

- Creating a repository in your github profile, hosting your materials, and sharing a link with your instructor.
- Creating a document or slide deck/PDF to share with an audience.
