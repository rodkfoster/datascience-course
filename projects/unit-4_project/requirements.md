<a name="proposal"></a>
## Final Project, Part 1: *Proposal*
   
> Frame your problem, criteria, and data source(s)

Describe your chosen problem and state whether you have access to relevant data. If you get stuck, [see this list of curated datasets](./suggestions.md).

#### Requirements
1. Draft a well-formed problem statement relevant to a business problem affecting your team, division, or organization.
2. Include the following elements:
   - Hypothesis/assumptions
   - Goals and success metrics
   - Risks or limitations
3. Identify at least one relevant internal dataset and confirm that you have (or can get) the right access permissions.


#### Submission
- Submit or share your project proposal as per your instructor's directions.

## Final Project, Part 2: *Brief*
> Perform EDA on your dataset

Exploratory data analysis is a crucial step in any data workflow. Create a Jupyter Notebook that explores your data mathematically and visually. Explore features, apply descriptive statistics, look at distributions, and determine how to handle sampling or any missing values.

#### Requirements
1. Create an exploratory data analysis notebook.
2. Perform statistical analysis, along with any visualizations.
3. Determine how to handle sampling or missing values.
4. Clearly identify shortcomings, assumptions, and next steps.

#### Submission
- Submit or share your project brief as per your instructor's directions.

<a name="notebook"></a>
## Final Project, Part 3: *Technical Notebook*
> Build and document a working model, prototype, recommendation, or solution.

Develop a prototype model or process to successfully resolve the business problem you've chosen. Document your work in a technical notebook that can be shared with your peers.

Build upon your earlier analysis, folling the performance metrics you established as part of your problem's evaluation criteria. Demonstrate your approach logically, including all relevant code and data. Polish your notebook for peer audiences by cleanly formatting sections, headers, and descriptions in markdown. Include comments in any code.

#### Requirements
1. A detailed Jupyter Notebook with a summary of your analysis, approach, and evaluation metrics.
2. Clearly formatted structure with section headings and markdown descriptions.
3. Comments explaining your code.

> Note: Here are some things to consider in your notebook: sample size, correlations, feature importance, unexplained variance or outliers, variable selection, train/test comparison, and any relationships between your target and independent variables.


#### Submission
- Submit or share your project brief as per your instructor's directions.

<a name="presentation"></a>
## Final Project, Part 4: *Presentation*
> Summarize and present your findings.

Present your findings to an audience that may include non-technical executive stakeholders. Summarize and break down your problem, approach, and recommendations in a manner that different levels of expertise will find informative and persuasive.

Create a presentation that walks through your goals, approach, results, and recommendations. Keep slides simple - no more than 2-3 pieces of information per slide. When in doubt, use visuals!

Finally, be prepared to explain and defend your model to an inquisitive audience.

> **Optional:** For a stretch challenge, try any of the following: creating an interactive demo of your model in action, explaining how you would deploy your model in a production environment, or discussing how to evaluate your solution's performance over time.

#### Requirements

1. Detailed presentation for non-technical audience.
2. Your presentation should include:
   - A problem statement.
   - Metrics and assumptions.
   - Approach and process.
   - Your model or solution.
   - Performance evaluation (how your approach compares to your original success metrics).
   - Impact of your findings.
   - Recommendations or next steps.

 4. *Optional:* Create/host an interactive demo of your model, explain how to deploy your model, or describe how you would evaluate performance over time.
