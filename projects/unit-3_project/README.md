## Due Date
For your due date, please see the course info page that has served as our syllabus.

Submissions must be made via pull request to _this_ repository (the default branch is fine) from your _own_ fork. Late submissions will **not** be accepted.

> Note: Student submissions should be submitted via pull request rather than by direct file sharing so that instructors can review using GitHub's rich "diff" feature. See preferred submission instructions below.

## Materials We Provide

| Topic | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Starter Code | [Project Description](modeling-project.ipynb) |
| Car MPG Data | [Highway MPGs of Many Popular Cars](./data/mpg.csv) |
| Diamond Data | [Measurements for Thousands of Diamonds](./data/diamonds.csv) |

## Project Objective

In this project, you'll build a linear regression (and KNN) model using guided prompts. You will be exposed to model validation using train/test split and cross-validation to fit your models.

For this project, you'll be:

  - Creating a train/test split of the data.
  - Training each of your models on the training data.
  - Evaluating each of the models on the testing data.
  - Ranking models by how well they scored on the testing data set.

## Project Requirements

In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the **required** questions. Your notebook should include:

1. Text for each question, including the starter code provided.
2. A **working** solution to each problem.
   - Do not include test, practice, or broken code (*unless you were unable to create a working solution*).
3. Comments for all of your code.
   - In your comments, describe any assumptions you made in order to solve the problems.
4. **Bonus**: After completing the required portions, try your hand at the **bonus** sections for some additional challenges!

## Rubric

For all projects, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0â€“3. Additionally, instructors will provide you with feedback on required portions of your project. Be sure to include comments and interpretations of the outputs of all of your code cells and figures.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Surpasses our wildest expectations!_

> Note: Scores of 2 mean that a requirement has been completely fulfilled, while 3 is typically reserved for bonus objectives.

## Submission

- **Preferred:** Forking the project repository, adding your solutions, and submitting a pull request back to the upstream repo from which you originally forked.
- **Not preferred:** Creating a repository in your GitHub profile, hosting your materials, and sharing a link with your instructor via Slack DM. _Be sure your instructor has read access to your repository._
